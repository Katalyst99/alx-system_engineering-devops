# 0x0B-ssh

## Description
This project focuses on understanding ssh. The most common way of connecting to a remote Linux server is through SSH. SSH stands for Secure Shell and provides a safe and secure way of executing commands, making changes, and configuring services remotely. When you connect through SSH, you log in using an account that exists on the remote server.

* What is a server
* Where servers usually live
* What is SSH
* How to create an SSH RSA key pair
* How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
* The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
* All your Bash script files must be executable
* The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
* The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script does
