# 0x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

## Description
This project delves into the fundamentals of shell scripting, focusing on loops, conditions, and parsing techniques in Bash. You'll learn how to construct various types of loops, implement conditional statements, and parse input/output data effectively.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:
* Understanding of loops (for, while, until) and their usage in shell scripting
* Implementing conditional statements (if, else, elif, case) for decision-making in scripts
* Parsing input and output data using command-line tools and Bash built-ins
* Enhancing scripts' functionality with loops, conditions, and parsing techniques

## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
* All Bash script files must be executable
* Your scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any error
* The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
* The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script does

## Topics Covered
* Loops: `for`, `while`, `until`
* Conditions: `if`, `else`, `elif`, `case`
* Parsing techniques: Command-line arguments, Input/output redirection, Text processing (e.g., `grep`, `awk`, `sed`)

## Examples
Here's a brief example of what you'll learn to accomplish with this project:
* Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks using loops
* Implementing decision-making logic in scripts based on specific conditions
* Parsing command-line arguments to customize script behavior
* Manipulating input/output data using various text-processing tools and techniques
